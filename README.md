# Code to Character

## Description
"Code to Character" is a Java-based project that uses the `Graphics` API to build a character out of code. By drawing shapes, applying colors, and manipulating graphics, I created a customizable character. The project showcases the integration of creativity and programming to design unique characters.

## Features
- Customizable character design
- Use of Java's `Graphics` API for drawing shapes and colors
- Simple animations and graphics manipulations

## Technologies Used
- Java (Swing for graphical interface)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run the `Powerpuffgirls` class.
4. The graphical interface will appear with the created character.
